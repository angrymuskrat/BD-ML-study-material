# QUANTUM INFORMATICS AND QUANTUM ALGORITHMS THEORY

## Условия сдачи / to pass this subject:
- oral exam
- two questions
- to evaluate A, you need to be well versed in the processes described in the course, in the corresponding mathematics and problems of quantum informatics
- there is no strict assessment measure, the assessment will depend on the average level of our knowledge (I wonder what will happen if everyone agrees to fail the exam?)
- to grade C, as far as I understand, it’s enough just to understand the problems of quantum computer science and processes without a good understanding of mathematics

## Additional info
- A list of questions for exam: He didn’t want to do it, but we kind of persuaded him
- He promised to send presentations
- If there is no the list, then the questions will be the names of the chapters in the presentations.
